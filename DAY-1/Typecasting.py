#typecasting
# Type casting refers to the process of converting the value of one data type into another. Python provides several built-in functions to facilitate casting, including int(), float() and str() among others. Basic casting functions are:

# int(): Converts compatible values to an integer.
# float(): Transforms values into floating-point numbers.
# str(): Converts any data type into a string.

s = "10"  
n = int(s)

cnt = 5
f = float(cnt) 

age = 25
s2 = str(age)  

print(n)  
print(f)  
print(s2)
