# Day 1 – Programming Foundations & Computer Basics

## Overview

Day 1 focuses on building a strong foundation in programming by understanding how a computer works internally, including basic hardware components, memory, operating systems, and the fundamentals of programming and Python.

To build a strong programming foundation, it is essential to understand the basic components of a computer system, including input and output devices, the CPU, memory, and the operating system.

---

## Input Devices

Input devices are used to provide data and instructions to a computer system.

Common input devices include:
- Keyboard – used to type text and commands
- Mouse – used to move the cursor and select items
- Touchpad – commonly used on laptops
- Scanner – converts physical documents into digital form
- Microphone – captures audio input

---

## Output Devices

Output devices display or produce the results generated by the computer.

Common output devices include:
- Monitor – displays text, images, and videos
- Speakers – produce audio output
- Earphones – provide personal audio output
- Printer – produces hard copies of documents

## CPU and Memory

The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the main processing unit of a computer.  
It executes instructions and performs arithmetic and logical operations.

Memory stores data and instructions needed during execution.

---

## Types of Memory

### Cache Memory
- High-speed memory located close to the CPU
- Stores frequently used data and instructions
- Improves CPU performance

### Main Memory (RAM)
- Temporary storage for running programs and data
- Data is lost when the system is powered off
- Programs are loaded into RAM for faster execution

### Secondary Storage
- Permanent storage for data and programs
- Retains data even when the computer is turned off
- Examples: Hard disk, SSD, USB drives, CDs, DVDs

---

## Operating System

The **Operating System (OS)** manages computer hardware and software resources.

Functions of the OS:
- Manages CPU, memory, and input/output devices
- Ensures smooth execution of programs
- Acts as a bridge between hardware and software
- Maintains system stability

### Examples of Operating Systems
- Windows
- Linux
- Unix
- macOS

## Computer Organization

Computer organization explains how different components of a computer system are arranged and connected to work together.

It helps in understanding:
- Hardware interaction
- Instruction execution
- Low-level processing of programs

## Basic Computer Instructions

Computer instructions are commands that tell the CPU how to perform tasks.  
They are grouped into three main categories.

### Data Transfer Instructions
- Load – moves data from memory to a register
- Store – moves data from a register to memory
- Move – transfers data between registers

### Arithmetic and Logic Instructions

**Arithmetic Instructions**
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide

**Logic Instructions**
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR

### Control Instructions

Control instructions determine the flow of execution in a program.

Common control instructions include:
- Jump (JMP)
- Conditional Branch
- Call
- Return

## Programming Languages

Programming languages allow humans to write instructions in a readable form that computers can execute.

- CPUs understand only binary (0s and 1s)
- High-level languages are easier to read and write
- Code is converted into machine language before execution

---

## Compilers and Interpreters

High-level programs are converted into machine code using:

- **Compiler** – converts the entire program at once
- **Interpreter** – executes the program line by line

---

## Why Do We Need Programming Languages?

A computer is very powerful, but it understands only **0s and 1s**.  
Humans think and communicate using words and logic, not binary numbers.

Writing instructions directly in binary is very difficult.  
Programming languages like **C, Java, and Python** allow humans to write instructions in a readable and structured way.

Compilers and interpreters translate these instructions into binary so the CPU can execute them.

## Download and Install Python (Quick Steps)

1. Go to **https://www.python.org** and download the latest **Python 3** version.
2. Run the downloaded installer (`.exe` on Windows).

## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simple and readable syntax.

Key features:
- Easy to learn and understand
- Requires fewer lines of code
- Automatically manages data types
- Supports multiple programming styles
